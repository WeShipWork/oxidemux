## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Minimal public facade for future core domains
The `oxmux` crate SHALL expose a small public facade that establishes ownership of proxy lifecycle, local health runtime, provider/auth, routing, protocol translation, configuration, streaming, management/status, usage/quota, and domain error primitives without implementing full provider or proxy routing behavior in this change.

#### Scenario: Provider auth ownership is visible but not implemented
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the `oxmux` public API or documentation
- **THEN** provider authentication and token refresh are identified as future core concerns without requiring OAuth UI, platform credential storage, or concrete provider clients in this phase

#### Scenario: Routing ownership is visible but not implemented
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the `oxmux` public API or documentation
- **THEN** model aliases, account targeting, priority, round-robin, failover, exhausted, and degraded routing states are identified as future core concerns without requiring routing algorithm implementations in this phase

#### Scenario: Protocol ownership exposes typed skeleton boundaries
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the `oxmux` public API or documentation
- **THEN** OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Codex, and provider-specific protocol translation are represented by typed request/response boundaries, typed protocol metadata, and deferred translation results without requiring request translators, response translators, or outbound provider calls in this phase

#### Scenario: Streaming ownership is visible but not implemented
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the `oxmux` public API or documentation
- **THEN** streaming and non-streaming response support are identified as future core concerns without requiring network transports or provider stream adapters in this phase

#### Scenario: Management ownership includes local health runtime status
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the `oxmux` public API or documentation
- **THEN** proxy lifecycle state, local health runtime status, provider listing, account health, usage, quota, and degraded service status are identified as core concerns while management endpoints beyond `/health` remain deferred
